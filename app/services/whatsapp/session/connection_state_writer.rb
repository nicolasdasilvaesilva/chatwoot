# The only writer of channel_whatsapp.provider_connection for session providers.
#
# Four rules live here, all of them learned from the Baileys layer:
#   1. Ownership fencing: a late event from a previous owner (lower lease epoch) must not
#      overwrite the current owner's state, or the inbox gets stuck reporting a stale
#      status while the connection is actually open.
#   2. Number ownership: a session paired with a number this inbox is not configured for
#      is somebody else's WhatsApp account, and no state may report it as usable.
#   3. Whole-hash replacement: qr_data_url, pairing_code, error and quarantine share the
#      lifecycle of the state they arrived with, so anything the new state does not carry
#      is cleared.
#   4. Sticky keys: reach-out lock and new-chat cap arrive out of band (poll or their own
#      event), so they survive a state update instead of flickering off until the next poll.
#
# Rule 2 lives here rather than in the event handler because a handler is only one of the
# ways a state is written: the pairing poll and the connect answer write one directly, and
# a check on the handler leaves those two admitting the wrong account.

  # the connect that follows it, and that `close` used to retire the attempt the connect
