# The three guards that make Whatsapp::Session::SilentWrite mean something.
#
# Declared here, and not as autoloaded classes, on purpose: a reloadable module handed to
# `prepend` is a new object after every reload, so the ancestor chain would grow one copy
# per edit in development. These are defined once at boot and re-prepended to whatever
# generation of the class `to_prepare` hands over, which Ruby ignores when the module is
# already in the chain.
#
# Prepended rather than edited into the classes themselves: all three are files the
# upstream sync rewrites, and a guard clause inside them is a conflict on every merge.
module WhatsappSessionImportGuards
  # Everything that acts on the world outside this request. An imported message may never
  # reach any of it, at either level of the flag: history that fires an automation, posts
  # an outgoing webhook or notifies an agent is history pretending to be an arrival.
  #
  # Stopped at enqueue rather than inside EventDispatcherJob, because the flag is scoped
  # to the importing thread and the job runs on another one, where it would read as unset.
  module SilentAsyncDispatch
    def dispatch(event_name, timestamp, data)
      return if Whatsapp::Session::SilentWrite.on?

      super
    end
  end

  # The two listeners that run in this thread. ActionCableListener is the push that moves
  # the operator's screen; AgentBotListener is a bot about to answer a message from June.
  # Under `:announce` the first is exactly what the import is for and the second is exactly
  # what it must not do, so the split is drawn by hand here instead of by the dispatcher.
  #
  # Wisper subscribes its listeners once, at boot, so there is no per-call listener set to
  # narrow: the announcing branch bypasses the publisher and calls the one listener it
  # allows, the same way the publisher would have. `respond_to?` because a listener only
  # implements the events it cares about, which is the check Wisper itself makes.
  module SilentSyncDispatch
    def dispatch(event_name, timestamp, data)
      return super unless Whatsapp::Session::SilentWrite.on?
      return unless Whatsapp::Session::SilentWrite.announce?

      event = Events::Base.new(event_name, timestamp, data)
      listener = ActionCableListener.instance
      listener.public_send(event.method_name, event) if listener.respond_to?(event.method_name)
    end
  end

  # What the dispatcher does not cover: reopening a resolved conversation, the message
  # template hooks (an out-of-office reply to a message from June), the outgoing send, the
  # contact activity stamp and the conversation activity stamp. The importer sets the
  # activity stamps itself, because the callback moves them to whatever it just wrote and
  # history is written oldest first.
  #
  # One of the seven is a message to the screen rather than an action, and under `:announce`
  # the gap needs it: without `message.created` the conversation card in the list updates
  # and the thread the operator has open stays empty, which is a worse place to stop than
  # not updating at all.
  #
  # Only the event is re-emitted, not `dispatch_create_events`, which wraps it in bookkeeping
  # this importer has taken over: the first-reply branch writes `first_reply_created_at` and
  # clears `waiting_since`, and the other branch recomputes `waiting_since` from a message
  # being written oldest first. Both would fight `settle` for the same columns.
