# What an import owes a conversation after the rows are in.
#
# Writing history with the ordinary callbacks suppressed (see SilentWrite) leaves the two
# clocks the inbox sorts and reports by untouched, and a thread the run opened carrying
# stamps that describe the import rather than the conversation. Both are put right here,
# once per conversation instead of once per message, and only in the direction that is
# true.
#
# Shared because there are two importers and only one correct answer: the session layer
# files the canonical providers, and the Baileys one runs the legacy pipeline for the
# frozen provider. A copy in each would drift, and the drift would show up as a thread
# sorted to the wrong place in the list, which nobody reads as a bug in an importer.
#
# The includer provides two things: `opened`, the ids of conversations this run created,
# and `announcing`, the block wrapper that lets the dashboard push through.

  # Both halves are settled together rather than one after the other, because a chat can
  # hand rows to each and the stamps have to see all of them at once: split in two, the
  # archive pass would read a conversation's rows without the newer gap rows beside them.
  # Which conversations may announce is therefore carried separately from the rows.

  # The archive has to be cleared rather than skipped. `handle_resolved_status_change`
  # clears the clock on a thread that *becomes* resolved, and an archive thread is born
  # resolved instead, so that callback never sees a status change -- leaving whatever
  # `ensure_waiting_since` stamped on it at creation. `Conversation.unattended` reads
  # `waiting_since` with no status of its own, so an import would otherwise file every
  # thread it created as unattended forever.

  #
  # A thread holding nothing but imported incoming rows is the test, rather than one this
  # run created: a dump arrives in frames filed by separate workers, so the thread a later
  # frame adds to was created by a worker whose `opened` this one cannot see, and keying on
  # that left a stamp three minutes behind the newest row. What the test protects is the
  # same thing either way -- on a thread that ever received live traffic an unread message
  # is somebody's real backlog, and hiding it would be the worse error.
  #
  # Read off the thread rather than off `rows`, and never moved backwards, so frames may
  # land in any order and each one leaves the same answer.
