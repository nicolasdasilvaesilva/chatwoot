# One webhook from a session provider that delivers over HTTP, translated and dispatched.
#
# The controller does nothing but authenticate and enqueue, so a translation this build
# cannot do never turns into a non-2xx the provider would keep retrying.
#
# ORDERING. The connector shards a session's events onto one thread and they arrive in
# order by construction; a webhook has no such guarantee, and there is nothing in the
# Uazapi payloads to rebuild one from (upstream chatwoot#373). Messages carry a
# millisecond timestamp, receipts carry seconds in one shape and an ISO string in
# another, and presence carries none at all, so a per-chat cursor has nothing monotonic
# to compare. What is left is to wait: a handler whose target message is not stored yet
# answers `:deferred` and this job retries, which turns an ordering problem into a
# bounded delay. A revoke or an edit for a message Chatwoot never had (one from before
# the inbox was connected) costs that ladder and is then dropped.
#
# The retry replays the whole body, so anything a translator emits alongside a deferrable
# event has to survive running twice. Only a bulk revoke does that today, and its handler
# is a no-op on a message it has already flagged.

  # The wait for a message that has not arrived yet. Bounded, and dropped at the end
