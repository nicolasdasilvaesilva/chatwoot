# Hold the worker until the schema it is about to load is the current one.
#
# ActiveRecord reads a model's columns once and keeps them for the life of the process, so
# a worker that loads Conversation one migration behind carries that schema until it is
# restarted. Every write that needs the new column then raises NoMethodError, and only the
# paths that CREATE a record reach it: an inbox with existing threads keeps receiving, and
# the loss surfaces as dead jobs nobody is watching. Measured on a real deploy: 672 history
# import jobs and 12 live messages dropped over eighty minutes, with nothing on the inbox
# saying so.
#
# docker-compose.coolify.yaml also states this as `depends_on: condition: service_healthy`,
# and that is not enough on its own. Coolify strips `depends_on` from the compose it
# actually deploys (verified on the stack that hit the bug), and docker does not re-apply
# the ordering when a single container is restarted later. The gate has to live somewhere
# it cannot be dropped, which is here.
#
# Wired into docker-compose.coolify.yaml and nowhere else. docker-compose.production.yaml
# is upstream's file and names upstream's image, which has no such script: pointing its
# worker here would break every deployment that runs it as checked in, to install a gate
# for a container that is not this fork's.
#
# The Rails container owns the migrations; this one only waits for them. A worker that
# comes up alone against a database nobody is migrating waits forever, on purpose: the
# wait shows up as an unhealthy container instead of as a worker quietly writing against
# the wrong schema. That only holds because the healthcheck drops this script from its
# match -- while the wait runs, PID 1 is still `sh docker/entrypoints/sidekiq.sh bundle
# exec sidekiq ...`, which a plain grep for sidekiq is happy to call a worker.

# Let DATABASE_URL env take presedence over individual connection params.
